# RobotStudio-Simulate-sealant-gun-
RobotStudio Assessment for MNFG309/409: Industrial Robotics and Automated Assembly. You will be required to program the robot to deposit a continuous bead of sealant around the edges of an injection moulded component. The simulated sealant gun must start in the pen holder on the cell table and must return there after the application has finished.
